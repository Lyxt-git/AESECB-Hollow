Note : 
For Python Script, the Fileless Memory Injection works well, any payload injected are good (PoC), but to ensure the Target Architecture is better in making the payload works without interruption.
In this case, Python version injected with payload size allocated, BUT the function is abnormal, may consider to enhance the Reconnaissance about the target system architecture before actual pwned.
